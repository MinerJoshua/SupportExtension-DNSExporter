### PROMPT

Working on a project
I am making a browser extension

Part of the functionality requires sending some data from my extension to my server to process
So far I have that set up so my extension makes an API call to receive a JSON object
It sends that object to the server which is processed into a list and sent back to the extension from the server as JSON

The extension would now use that list to make new API calls and after retrieving that data send it to the server again for processing
